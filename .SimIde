Running simulation:

x- Ai generates up to X random bots
x- Each bot has a random DNA
x- Bots then compete to get --fasters/--furthest difference in --distance/--seconds
- Weak bots die (ai tries not to generate them again)
- Great bots make new bots.
-x If your bot is in the 'weak' category you get punished: (loose strand, not able to change, )
x- If your bot is in the 'great' category you get rewarded: (new strand, more space)



Your Ai went XXX distance in YYY time
and came ZZZ position.

AAA% of the population died, and (unfortunately, fortunately) your ai came in
ZZZ position and (survived / died)

Your (reward/punishment) is BBB of Item.
